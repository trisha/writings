# What to Expect From a Software Engineering Interview Circuit

I'm writing this article for two primary reasons:

- As a resource for future Trisha when she's interviewing for software engineering roles again
- For friends/startups who don't have a recruitment playbook and don't know where to begin

Note: I call it an interview circuit but I haven't heard anyone else call it that. Circuit means itinerary in this context.
I have experience interviewing as a non-senior backend and fullstack engineer with super small companies sub 10 or 20 people, and also with medium-sized startups as well as large companies.

## Applying
*Note: Apologies in advance that Medium doesn't support nested bullet points. That's why "One:" instead of "1."

#### Applying to Smaller Companies (<300 people)*

One. Your best way to find out about these companies is by networking in San Francisco. There is no dearth of founders working on interesting problems. 
- This means at tech events in real life, as well as on Twitter. I've gotten interviews by posting on Twitter that I'm a software engineer looking for my next role, and got one of my previous jobs that way. The more of a presence you've already built on Twitter, the more likely more people will like and share your tweet. **People who are hiring come to you.**

Two. The second best way to find out about super small companies is by creating a profile on Wellfound, formerly known as Angellist jobs. There's also a monthly "Who is Hiring" thread on Hack News. **You go to people whom you know are hiring.**

Three. The third best way to find super small companies to apply to is to go through any sort of list - whether that be Hacker Rank news, a list of companies you know and like, or VC portfolio cos, and check their careers page to see if they're hiring. 
- If there's no relevant role but you're still interested, you'll want to contact someone you know at the company as your warm intro. Otherwise, try the CEO, CTO, or director of engineering (anyone responsible for filling out their [engineering] team). You can expect that the companies with fewer than 20 people won't have a dedicated recruiter, and if they do then the CEO can reroute them to you anyway. 
- This strategy is less ideal because you're going to companies that might not be hiring.

#### Applying to Larger Companies (>300 people)

To improve your odds of your resume being considered more thoroughly by a recruiter, get a referral if you can.

If I'm talking to someone in real life, I ask if I can ask them for a referral. Then I follow up even, if it's to say I didn't find any relevant openings and to let me know if they hear of junior SWE positions they're looking to hire that might not have gotten listed yet. Sometimes, they're told to tell me to apply to the Senior role so they can consider me for non-senior roles.

If I'm reaching out to someone online, I find a job listing and ask them if they can refer me for this specific role I thought I'd be a good fit for, and include my resume to reduce back and forth. 
If you're cold applying without a referral, then grab words from the job description and sprinkle them into your resume before uploading. 

I've tried using Teal and ChatGPT to help me reword my resume based on job descriptions, but right now it requires a lot of manual intervention because in many cases it actually changes the meaning of what it says I did, but for the most part I can take their phrasing and choose my own injection site. 

## Recruiter Screen
After you apply, there are 3 main outcomes:
- You get rejected or don't hear back, aka there are no next steps
- You're sent an automated coding assessment that you have to pass before the recruiter screen
- Receive an email from someone to schedule an intro call

I appreciate the recruiters who offer me their Calendly since it makes scheduling so much easier and removes the back and forth. Otherwise, I have to write out my availability.

What Calendly's scheduling interface looks like.

They will ask you if you're authorized to work in the US and avoid asking about your citizenship status so as to avoid discrimination law suits from non-US citizens. That said, I always share that "I'm a US citizen so yes I have work authorization" and that way they don't have to worry about *future* work authorization.

#### Smaller Companies (<300 people)

Your recruiter screen will be around 30 minutes because smaller companies will have to sell their name and their vision to you, and because they're more variable, you'll be asking more questions.
I'm an engineer optimizing for my growth trajectory and not a VC investing to get outsized returns, so my questions center around:

- Do you have an in-person office, if so how often does the team go into the office and where is it

#### Larger Companies (>300 people)
Your recruiter screen will be around 15–30 minutes, usually 30 minutes.
